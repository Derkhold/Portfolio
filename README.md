## Introduction

This portfolio documents my ongoing exploration of quantitative trading and system design through hands-on, code-driven experimentation.

Rather than focusing on pre-packaged solutions or academic exercises, I’ve chosen to build things from scratch — to understand how trading logic can be structured, tested, and adapted in realistic environments. Each project here reflects a stage in that learning process: from writing clean, modular code to simulating executions and designing reusable components.

My goal is to go beyond isolated scripts and move toward a more engineering-minded approach to finance. I’m interested in how trading systems are actually built — how strategies interface with risk controls, how code architecture supports clarity and flexibility, and how outputs can be made transparent and audit-ready.

This portfolio isn’t intended as a final product. It’s a snapshot of what I’ve built so far, and a foundation I plan to improve and expand as I continue learning.

## About Me

I'm currently studying Financial Markets at NEOMA Business School. While my academic program focuses on market theory, products, and macro structure, I've gradually built a strong interest in the technical side of finance — especially how trading ideas can be turned into working systems.

I'm a self-motivated learner. I started by writing basic scripts to analyze price data, then progressively became more interested in building real components: backtest engines, order and risk managers, reporting tools.  
That process made me appreciate the difference between writing code and designing systems — and gave me a better sense of what’s needed to build something maintainable, transparent, and usable.

I don’t aim to replicate complex models yet — I prefer to understand the foundations first. My approach is iterative: I try something, break it, improve it, and document it. This portfolio reflects that mindset more than any finished product.
